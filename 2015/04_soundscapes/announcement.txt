Soundscapes are the full auditory scene a person perceives.

For Earth Day, Monthly Music Hackathon NYC is partnering with NYU’s Citygram project to present talks, workshops, and a hackathon on a wide range of subjects related to soundscapes: audio sensor networks, noise pollution, immersive sound art, research on environmental sound perception in animals, and more. Hack on your own projects or Citygram's data and tools.

All are welcome to come build a sound art installation in this room, as long as you're happy with other people also building sound art installations near you, and you can coordinate with each other -- or agree not to coordinate.
